cPanel-TaskQueue version 0.300

The cPanel::TaskQueue module was designed to deal with the situation where more
than one cooperating process work through a queue of tasks that need to be
performed.

The normal usage scenario would be one (or more) processes that are taking
'commands' (or tasks formatted as a string) from somewhere and adding them to
the TaskQueue. Another process would be taking tasks from the queue and executing
them. The execution process can spawn child processes to do the work if necessary.
This process can also limit the number of child processes running at any point
in time.

The cPanel::TaskQueue itself is a wrapper and interface around a disk file that
persists the queue and provides safe concurrent access to the data stored in the
queue.
