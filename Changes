0.606     2014-03-06 19:51:16 UTC
0.606     2014-02-20 12:56:10 America/Chicago
       Only update state file if not already up to date.
0.605     2013-04-12 11:09:30 America/Chicago
       Remove concurrency problem that could result in lost tasks. Weaken
       reference to data object that causes a memory leak.
0.604     2012-11-29 12:41:58 America/Chicago
       Correct scheduler code to use the new reconstitute method to restore
       task objects loaded from disk.
0.603     2012-11-26 10:47:36 America/Chicago
       Add flag to prevent YAML::Syck from reblessing objects from disk. This
       turns out to be a security problem. Add c::TQ::Task::reconstitute class
       method to recreate Task objects that have been serialized.
0.602     2012-10-26 16:06:06 America/Chicago
       Correct importing of cPanel::TaskQueue::Scheduler in the module
       cPanel::TaskQueue::ChildProcessor. Failed if configuration had been set
       to non-defaults elsewhere in the code.
0.601     2011-09-15 16:19:13 America/Chicago
       Better handling of conversion of state files in taskqueuectrl.
       Add 'info' command that displays serialization information.
       Corrected error is pause/resume handling.
       Added a 'process' command to force the TaskQueue to execute a task.
0.600     2011-09-14 12:40:57 America/Chicago
       Add support for serializing the queue and scheduler data in Storable
       format as well as YAML.
       Default the queue and scheduler to Storable for serialization.
       Provide command in taskqueuectl to convert from one serialization format
       to another.
       Improve test coverage.
0.504     2011-07-28 12:14:24 America/Chicago
       Testing had shown no more problems. Upgrading to an official release.
0.503_04  2011-07-15 13:26:37 America/Chicago
       One more attempt to kill the race condition reported by CPANTESTERS.
0.503_03  2011-07-11 11:15:02 America/Chicago
       Many CPANTESTERS machines apparently do not allow writing to /tmp, but
       still have File::Spec->tmpdir() returning that directory. Modified temp
       directory handlign in tests.
       Modify test to reduce failure due to race condition.
0.503_02  2011-01-25 12:12:37 America/Chicago
       More CPANTESTERS cleanup.
0.503_01  2011-01-04 15:55:34 America/Chicago
       Clean up errors found by CPANTESTERS.
       Correct t/taskqueue_processor_checked_system.t to allow it to pass on
       a Solaris or Windows system.
       Fixed the same test to correctly handle a missing Test::Exception module.
       Attempt to make statefile_load_save test more robust.
       Make task_scheduler test more robust.
0.503     2011-01-03 10:49:47 America/Chicago
       Fix a Fork/exception interaction in cPanel::TaskQueue::ChildProcessor
       that results in multiple server processes running.
0.502     2010-11-22 12:13:24 America/Chicago
       Pass the logger object from the CacheFile to the process_task routine
       on the processor. This way the processor can log properly.
       Make certain that a task with no processor is removed from the queue.
       Add checked_system utility method in Processor object.
0.501     2010-11-17 13:39:41 America/Chicago
       Correct dependencies to remove local testing modules.

       Add ability to pause processing waiting tasks into the processing phase.

       Reduce aggressiveness of the file locking on the queue file in the
         code checking for completed child processess.
0.301  Fri Apr 29 16:30:00 2010
       Prevent scheduler from updating schedule file unnecessarily.
       Reduce file locking for schedule and queue files that are not changing.
